## A Healthy Ecosystem in Blockchain

The existing internet social networks are run by the capital, which always pursues profits and seeks manipulation. In this system, true freedom of speech doesn't exist.

The blockchain is a public network and the cyrpotcurrency runs the blockchain engine as the fuel. <b>RETURN</b> is inspired by the "Memember" app on Bitcoin, which distinguishes it from any other existing internet-based networks. <b>RETURN</b> hooks up an existing cryptocurrency as its fuel. The miners of the cyptocurrency are paid to sustain the virtuous cycle of the <b>RETURN</b>. Anyone who has a computer can become a miner to support the healthy growth of the ecosystem. Those who do not wish to participate in mining can buy the cryptocurrency from miners in the free market.

## How it Works?

<b>RETURN</b> runs on independent servers. Blockchain technology allows data to be stored in servers anywhere in the world. It is based on open-source software and functions a lot like <b>Twitter</b> but owned by nobody. It enforces transparency, as the data can be viewed in real time by anyone from anywhere.

## Will your be Censored or Shutdown?

No one can modify or delete your messages in <b>RETURN</b>. You are the only one who is in control. Your messages can be seen everywhere in the world, even behind the <b>strongest firewall</b>! <b>RETURN</b> runs on independent servers from all over the world. It is impossible to shutdown once it starts. More people join, the stronger the RETURN becomes.

## How do People Connect in Blockchain?

<b>RETURN</b> randomly assigns you an unique 8 digits ID which you can share with anyone you wish. Through this unique ID, people can easily connect with you on the blockchain. The number of digits will grow when more people join the RETURN.
